Description: Native JACK/ALSA MIDI live sequencer refactored from seq24 and sequencer64.
 Seq66 provides major upgrades to seq24: C++14 support, support for
 native JACK MIDI, SMF 0 files, a range of PPQN values, more MIDI controls,
 more scales, chord-generation, expanded configuration options, pause,
 event-editing window, tap-tempo, more keystroke control, and many other
 enhancements and fixes.  A Qt-5-based application, it also builds on that
 other operating system.
